My reflections on the project
---------------------------------------------
This is going to be a stepping stone towards my goal of becoming a full stack developer.The knowledge
related to the DOM was surely tougher to absorb than HTML and CSS.The project was challening and now
I feel myself grown a little bit more.The end product has this very rewarding feeling.
